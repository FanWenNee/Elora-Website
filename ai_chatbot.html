            const allFAQs = [
                { question: "What is the best basic skincare routine?", answer: "A basic skincare routine should include cleansing, moisturizing, and sun protection. In the morning: cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen. At night: cleanser, treatment products (if needed), moisturizer." },
                { question: "How many steps should a skincare routine have?", answer: "A skincare routine can range from 3 steps (cleanse, moisturize, sunscreen) to 10 steps. Start simple and add products based on your skin's needs." },
                { question: "Should I wash my face in the morning and at night?", answer: "Yes, you should wash your face both morning and night. In the morning, it removes oil and sweat. At night, it removes dirt, oil, makeup, and pollutants." },
                { question: "What order should I apply my skincare products in?", answer: "Apply products from thinnest to thickest consistency: cleanser, toner, serums, treatments, eye cream, moisturizer, oils, sunscreen (in the morning)." },
                { question: "How do I know if a product suits my skin?", answer: "A product suits your skin if it doesn't cause irritation, redness, breakouts, or discomfort. It should leave your skin feeling balanced and comfortable." },
                { question: "How long does it take to see results from skincare?", answer: "Most skincare products take 4-8 weeks to show visible results, as this is the skin's natural renewal cycle. Some active ingredients may take 3-6 months for full effects." },
                { question: "Is it okay to mix different skincare brands?", answer: "Yes, it's generally fine to mix different skincare brands. Focus on ingredient compatibility rather than brand matching." },
                { question: "How do I patch test a new skincare product?", answer: "Apply a small amount of product to a discreet area (like behind the ear) for several days. If no irritation occurs after 72 hours, it's likely safe for your face." },
                { question: "Do men need skincare routines too?", answer: "Yes, men have skin with the same basic needs as women. The fundamentals of cleansing, moisturizing, and sun protection apply to everyone." },
                { question: "Can I skip moisturizer if I have oily skin?", answer: "No, even oily skin needs moisturizer. Skipping moisturizer can actually cause your skin to produce more oil to compensate for dehydration." }
